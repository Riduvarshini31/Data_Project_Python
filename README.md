# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from Luke Barousse's Python Course which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

- What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
- How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
- How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
- What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand and High Paying)

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data.
- **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
Seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

### Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

# Filter United States Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']```

# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles),1, figsize=(8,6))
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_count[df_skills_count['job_title'] == job_title].head(5)
    df_plot.plot(kind='barh', x='job_skills', y='skill_count', ax=ax[i], title=job_title)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_count', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].invert_yaxis()
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)
    plt.xlim(0,7000)
   

fig.suptitle('Count of Top Skills in Job Postings', fontsize=15) 
plt.tight_layout() 
plt.show()  
```

### Results

### Insights

- SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill, appearing in job postings.
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be proficient in more general data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).
- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists and Data Engineers.

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

### Visualize Data

```python
df_DA_US_pivot.iloc[:, :5].plot(kind='line')

plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.xlabel('')
plt.show()
```
### Results

### Insights:

- SQL remains the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand.
- Excel experienced a significant increase in demand starting around September, surpassing both Python and Tableau by the end of the year.
- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skills for data analysts. Power BI, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Jobs?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](Project\4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Visualize

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short',order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()

plt.title('Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600000) 
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()
```

### Results

# Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analyst?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb)

### Visualize

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text

plt.scatter(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'])
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Salary ($USD)')  # Assuming this is the label you want for y-axis
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US')

ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))  # Example formatting y-axis

texts = []
for i, txt in enumerate(df_DA_skills_high_demand.index):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'].iloc[i], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'].iloc[i], " " + txt))

adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))

plt.show()
```
### Results

# Insights:

- The skill Oracle appears to have the highest median salary of nearly $97K, despite being less common in job postings. This suggests a high value placed on specialized database skills within the data analyst profession.

- More commonly required skills like Excel and SQL have a large presence in job listings but lower median salaries compared to specialized skills like Python and Tableau, which not only have higher salaries but are also moderately prevalent in job listings.

- Skills such as Python, Tableau, and SQL Server are towards the higher end of the salary spectrum while also being fairly common in job listings, indicating that proficiency in these tools can lead to good opportunities in data analytics.
